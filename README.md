## Project Proposal: Road Accident Severity Prediction

### 1. Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing the **UK Road Traffic Accidents dataset** (sourced from Kaggle) collected through the **STATS19 reporting system**. Each record includes detailed accident information such as:

* Location (coordinates, district)
* Time and date
* Road characteristics (type, speed limit, junction details)
* Environmental conditions (weather, lighting, road surface)
* Vehicles involved and casualties

The goal is to **clean, preprocess, and explore** this dataset to prepare it for **predictive modeling** that identifies patterns and relationships affecting road accident severity. Insights from the analysis will support:

* Severity prediction (Slight, Serious, Fatal)
* Hotspot identification
* Environmental and temporal factor analysis.

### 3. Objectives

* Predict accident severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal) using historical data.
* Identify key contributing factors (speed limit, road type, weather, lighting, time).
* Detect high-risk locations (hotspots) for better resource allocation.
* Analyze time-based risk patterns (day of week, time of day).
* Assess environmental impact on accident severity.
* Provide actionable recommendations for traffic safety improvements.

### 6. Business Objective

Reduce road accident fatalities and injuries by predicting accident severity and identifying key risk factors related to **location, time, and environmental conditions**.

**Targets:**

* Predict accident severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal).
* Detect high-risk vs. low-risk locations.
* Assess time-based risk patterns.
* Understand environmental impact on severity.

**Recommendations:**

* Increase police presence in hotspots.
* Enforce speed monitoring on rural roads.
* Improve lighting in night-accident areas.
* Apply weather-based alerts and speed limits.
* Add speed bumps or traffic signals at risky junctions.
